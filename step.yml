  Run Xcode Archive command and export an iOS IPA.

  You can share it, upload it, deploy it and catch them
  all! Well, maybe not the last one.

      description: |
        (optional) The configuration to use. By default your Scheme
        defines which configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,
        but you can overwrite it with this option.

        **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
        in your Xcode Project**. If it does not, if you have a typo
        in the value of this input Xcode will simply use the Configuration
        specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!

    opts:

  - force_code_sign_identity:
    opts:
      title: "Force code signing with Identity"
      description: |-
        Force xcodebuild to use specified Code Sign Identity.

        Specify code sign identity as full ID (e.g. `iPhone Developer: Bitrise Bot (VV2J4SV8V4)`)
        or specify code sign group ( `iPhone Developer` or `iPhone Distribution` ).

        You also have to **specify the Identity in the format it's stored in Xcode project settings**,
        and **not how it's presented in the Xcode.app GUI**!
        This means that instead of `iOS` (`iOS Distribution/Development`) you have to use
        `iPhone` (`iPhone Distribution` or `iPhone Development`).
        **Capitalization also matters**, `iPhone Distribution` works but `iphone distribution` does not!
  - force_provisioning_profile:
    opts:
      title: "Force code signing with Provisioning Profile"
      description: |-
        Force xcodebuild to use specified Provisioning Profile.

        Use Provisioning Profile's UUID, profile's name is not acceptable by xcodebuild.

        How to get your UUID:

        - In xcode select your project -> Build Settings -> Code Signing
        - Select the desired Provisioning Profile, then scroll down in profile list and click on Other...
        - The popup will show your profile's UUID.

        Format example:

        - c5be4123-1234-4f9d-9843-0d9be985a068
  - export_options_path:
    opts:
      title: "Export options path"
      description: |-
        Used for Xcode version 7 and above.

        Specifies a path to a plist file that configures archive exporting.
        If empty, step generates these options based on provisioning profile,
        with default values.

        Auto generated export options available for export methods:

        - app-store
        - ad-hoc
        - enterprise
        - development

        If step doesn't find export method based on provisioning profile, development will be use.

        Call xcodebuild -help for available export options.

      title: Output tool
      description: |-
        If output_tool is set to xcpretty, the xcodebuild output will be prettified by xcpretty.
        If output_tool is set to xcodebuild, the raw xcodebuild output will be printed.

        If this input is set to `yes` step will collect every dsym (.app dsym and framwork dsyms) in a directory, zip it and export the zipped directory path.
        Otherwise only .app dsym will be zipped and the zip path exported.
