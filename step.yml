title: Xcode Archive & Export for iOS
summary: Run the Xcode archive command and then export an .ipa from the archive.
description: |-

   The Step archives your Xcode project by running the `xcodebuild archive` command and then exports the archive into an .ipa file with the `xcodebuild -exportArchive` command. This .ipa file can be shared, installed on test devices, or uploaded to the App Store Connect.

   ### Configuring the Step

   Before you can use the Step, you need code signing files. Certificates must be uploaded to Bitrise while provisioning profiles should be either uploaded or, if using the iOS Auto Provisioning Step, downloaded from the Apple Developer Portal or generated automatically.

   To configure the Step:

   1. Make sure the **Project (or Workspace) path** input points to the correct location.

      By default, you do not have to change this.
   1. Set the correct value to the **Select method for export** input. If you use the **iOS Auto Provision** Step, the value of this input should be the same as the **Distribution type** input of that Step.
   1. Make sure the target scheme is a valid, existing Xcode scheme.
   1. Optionally, you can define a configuration type to be used (such as Debug or Release) in the **Configuration name** input.

      By default, the selected Xcode scheme determines which configuration will be used. This option overwrites the configuration set in the scheme.
   1. If you wish to use a different Developer portal team than the one set in your Xcode project, enter the ID in the **he Developer Portal team to use for this export** input.

   ### Troubleshooting

   If the Step fails, check your code signing files first. Make sure they are the right type for your export method. For example, an `app-store` export method requires an App Store type provisioning profile and a Distribution certificate.

   Check **Debug** for additional options to run the Step. The **Additional options for xcodebuild call** input allows you add any flags that the `xcodebuild` command supports.

   Make sure the **Scheme name** and **Configuration name** inputs contain values that actually exist in your Xcode project.

        Could make the build faster by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command which will disable the indexing during the build.

        Indexing is needed for

        * Autocomplete
        * Ability to quickly jump to definition
        * Get class and method help by alt clicking.

        Which are not needed in CI environment.

        **Note:** In Xcode you can turn off the `Index-WhileBuilding` feature  by disabling the `Enable Index-WhileBuilding Functionality` in the `Build Settings`.<br/>
        In CI environment you can disable it by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command.

        Specify Code Signing Identity as full ID (e.g. `iPhone Developer: Bitrise Bot (VV2J4SV8V4)`)
        or specify code signing group ( `iPhone Developer` or `iPhone Distribution` ).

        You also have to **specify the Identity in the format it's stored in Xcode project settings**,
        and **not how it's presented in the Xcode.app GUI**!
        This means that instead of `iOS` (`iOS Distribution/Development`) you have to use
        `iPhone` (`iPhone Distribution` or `iPhone Development`).
        **The input is case sensitive**: `iPhone Distribution` works but `iphone distribution` does not!

        Used for Xcode version 8 and above.

        Force xcodebuild to use specified Provisioning Profile (`PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER`).

        How to get your Provisioning Profile Specifier:

        - In Xcode make sure you disabled `Automatically manage signing` on your project's `General` tab
        - Now you can select your Provisioning Profile Specifier's name as `Provisioning Profile` input value on your project's `General` tab
        - `force_provisioning_profile_specifier` input value build up by the Team ID and the Provisioning Profile Specifier name, separated with slash character ('/'): `TEAM_ID/PROFILE_SPECIFIER_NAME`

        Format example:

        - `1MZX23ABCD4/My Provisioning Profile`
  - custom_export_options_plist_content:
    opts:
      category: Debug
      title: "Custom export options plist content"
      description: |-
        Used for Xcode version 7 and above.

        Specifies a custom export options plist content that configures archive exporting.
        If empty, the step generates these options based on provisioning profile,
        with default values.

        Auto generated export options available for export methods:

        - app-store
        - ad-hoc
        - enterprise
        - development

        If the step doesn't find an export method based on the provisioning profile, the development method will be used.

        Call `xcodebuild -help` for available export options.
